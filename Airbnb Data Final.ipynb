    "3. A LOT of missing data\n",

    "In this dataset, I'm particularly interested in one thing: How do people profit from joining Airbnb? However, in answering this question, I'm going to need to answer a few questions:\n",
    "1. What determines customers' buying decision in Airbnb?\n",
    "2. What influences customers' rating for a house after they stay on it?\n",
    "3. What kind of amenities a host should have to be able to get high ratings and get customers to use this host's house?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Customer buying decsion\n",
    "There is no specific variable that tells me about customer buying decision. Therefore, I need a proxy to represent this variable. What came in my mind was 'number_of_reviews'. Although it might not be the best proxy (since there are customers who do not rate after their purchase), it's the only thing that comes close to customer's buying decision. Thus, I decided to select 'number_of_reviews', which tells us about how many times the house has been reviewed, as the proxy for customer buying decision.\n",

    "For the first phase of the data cleaning, I decided to drop some variables which was not interesting to me. The variables I dropped are:\n",
    "1. The url variables, except for thumbnail_url (I'm going to use thumbnail_url later).\n",
    "2. Variables relating to location except for city, neighborhood_cleansed, and zipcode. This is because each house is in USA, whether it's in Boston or Seattle. And these houses have unique latitude and longitude. So, I decided to drop this. \n",
    "3. A couple of host related variable such as host_url, host_name, etc. I'm more interested in the property instead of the host data.\n",
    "4. Summary and description. I think summary and description is a bit advanced for me to categorize them based using NLP or something else. \n",
    "5. Availability related variables. I wouldn't need these variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I'm going to address some data issues which is:\n",
    "1. Price related variables have datatype object\n",
    "2. Percentage related variables have datatype object\n",
    "3. I'm going to use thumbnail_url column to create thumbnail_available column. If there is a url in the thumbnail_url column, I assumed that there is a thumbnail in the house page. Otherwise, there is no thumbnail in the house page.\n",
    "4. The missing values on 'city', 'state', and 'cleaning_fee'. I'm going to impute using mode for 'city' and 'state'. For 'cleaning_fee', my assumption is that when the row is empty, the host doesn't charge cleaning fee. \n",
    "6. Host verifications -> converting this into verification_method which is the number of verification method available.\n",
    "7. The NaN values in weekly_price and monthly_price will be filled with 0. I will then create 2 new columns, price_per_week with 7 x price as the values if the weekly_price value is NaN and price_per_month with 30 x price as the values if the monthly_price value is NaN.\n",
    "8. host_since will be converted to host_year, indicating how many years has someone been an Airbnb host."

    "Now, we look at a different proxy of customers' buying decision which is reviews_per_month. Customers look at minimum nights in choosing houses. It seems that they are long-stayers who prefer to stay in a house longer as well. Again, ratings play an important role. The higher the rating is, the more likely customers choose the house. Instant bookable is another feature which is important in customers' buying decision. This indicates that customers look for availability. \n",

    "### Summing up\n",
    "By observing the impact of these variables to customers' buying decision (with 2 proxies), we can conclude that there are a few main things to consider if hosts want their properties to be popular / booked:\n",
    "1. Rating. Getting higher rating is mandatory. Thus, it's better if hosts provide the best service they can.\n",
    "2. Reliability. The host's experience and the fact that a host is a huge plus. Airbnb superhosts are responsive, reliable, have high rating, and active. Being a superhost with years of experience helps the customers to gain trust to the host and therefore book their properties.\n",
    "3. House properties. Airbnb customers seem to be long-stayers. They also want fast booking, in the sense that the property must be available during their browsing time."

Interestingly, customers tend to book properties without kitchen. Maybe, houses with kitchen have higher price. I will look at this later. Houses with heating tend to get more booking as well. Probably in the US, heating is important if customers travel in winter."

    "As I suspected, houses with kitchen has higher average price. This contradicts previous findings stating the higher the price, the higher the customers' buying decision. Probably, the impact is not significant. However, customers tend to prefer longer stay. Usually, hosts provide cheaper price if customers book for a long stay. Thus, the influence of price to customers' buying decision need to be looked at more in details. Needless to say, more research is needed on this.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "I did all this to answer the question: 'How do people profit from becoming Airbnb hosts?'. I can conclude that to do that:\n",
    "1. We need to provide the best service we can. It's easy to say, difficult to do (as a former hotelier, I can assure you this). If we do that, we can be given a chance to be promoted to superhost. If we get to superhost, it means that we get high ratings most of the time. Higher ratings mean higher bookings.\n",
    "2. Provide neccessary amenities. Customers don't really care about certain amenities such as kitchen. Moreover, providing unneeded amenities might increase price since people invested on these amenities. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations:\n",
    "1. In filling the NaN values, I used mostly machine learning techniques. Actually, in my last Udacity project, a reviewer told me that we can fill NaN values using this and I wanted to try it. I'm not really sure that it's right or wrong.\n",
    "2. I made a couple of assumptions such as the NaN values of cleaning fee is actually 0 (the host doesn't ask for cleaning fee) and the NaN values for host_year is also 0, indicating that these hosts are new host with 0 year experience. I could be wrong."
